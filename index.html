                            <h5 class="center">Siding / Gutter Repair & Installation</h5>
                            <p class="light">Siding forms the first line of defense against the elements, most importantly sun, rain/snow, heat and cold, thus creating a stable, more comfortable environment on the interior of your home. The siding material and style also can enhance or detract from the building's beauty. There is a wide and expanding variety of materials to side with, both natural and artificial, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Gutters help to channel and redirect the flow of rain water from your roof, away from your patio, entryway and landscaping. Improper gutter installation causes the water to drain improperly and can lead to issues such as rotten wood and foundation damage. Over time this can cause problems to the structure as well as cosmetic damage to your home costing thousands of dollars.</p>
